I copied some assembler routines from magazines into my BASIC programs back in the 80s, but I could never find a book in the library on how to actually program assembler.

When I programmed PalmPilots I wrote assembler blocks in my C code for performance.

But I've never written a whole assembler program before, like I wanted to back on my ZX Spectrum+.

So, this is my little hobby project to write something purely in assembler for the ZX Spectrum.

It's an animated scene, not a game, as I just want to focus on clever tricks for speed, like in demos, rather than worry about moving enemies and tracking misslies. 

Toolchain is basically this: http://www.breakintoprogram.co.uk/hardware/computers/zx-spectrum/assembly-language/z80-development-toolchain -- VScode IDE, sjasmplus compiler, ZEsarUX emulator, DeZog debugger & simulator, plus Z80 assembler highlighting - once you get it working by learning from a sample project https://github.com/maziac/z80-sample-program and associated VScode extensions, it's a proper modern IDE experience for ZX Spectrum assembler development!

Also have FUSE, Notepad++ and HxD from my simpler days...
