I copied some assembler routines from magazines into my BASIC programs back in the 80s, but I could never find a book in library on how to actually program assembler.

When I programmed PalmPilots I wrote assembler blocks in my C code for performance.

But I've never written a whole assembler program, like I wanted to back on my ZX Spectrum+.

So, this is my little hobby project to write something purely in assembler for the ZX Spectrum.

It's an animated scene, not a game, as I just want to focus on clever tricks for speed, like in demos, rather than worry about moving enemies and tracking misslies.
